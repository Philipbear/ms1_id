## Pseudo MS/MS spectra

Pseudo MS/MS spectra can be generated using many tools, such as CAMERA, CliqueMS and xMSannotator. `ms1_id` can annotate pseudo MS/MS spectra in **mgf** format.

Here we provide an example of generating pseudo MS/MS spectra using xcms and CAMERA in R language ([`camera_demo.R`](https://github.com/Philipbear/ms1_id/blob/main/camera_demo/camera_demo.R)). 

Users are encouraged to use their own tools to generate pseudo MS/MS spectra.
